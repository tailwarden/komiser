- Share your idea(s) in the **#feature-request** channel and get feedback from the community.

### For Bug Reports and Minor Fixes

🐞 **Found a bug and wish to fix it?** Each and every contribution matters regardless of its size!

Here are a few things to keep in mind in this case:

- Before creating a new issue, please make sure to check for an already [existing issue](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/issues) for that bug.
- If an issue doesn't exist, [create a new issue](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/issues/new/choose) of **\`type: Bug Report\`** and make sure to provide as much detail as possible.
- Feel free to reach out to us on **#contributors** or **#feedback** channel on our Discord Server, if you need any assistance or have questions.

## General Contribution Flow

This section covers the **general contribution flow** when contributing to any area of **Komiser (Engine or the UI)** and some best practices to follow along the way.

Following these steps will ensure that your contributions are well-received, reviewed, and integrated effectively into Komiser's codebase.

### Fork and Pull Request Flow

1️⃣ Head over to the [Komiser GitHub repo](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser) and "fork it" into your own GitHub account.

2️⃣ Clone your fork to your local machine, using the following command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/FORKED-PROJECT.git
```

3️⃣ Create a new branch based-off **\`develop\`** branch:
```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b fix/XXX-something develop
```
Make sure to follow the following branch naming conventions:
- For feature/enchancements, use: **\`feature/xxxx-name_of_feature\`**
- For bug fixes, use: **\`fix/xxxx-name_of_bug\`**
> Here, **\`xxxx\`** is the issue number associated with the bug/feature!
> For example:
> ```bash
> git checkout -b feature/1022-kubecost-integration develop
> ```

4️⃣ Implement the changes or additions you intend to contribute. Whether it's **bug fixes**, **new features**, or **enhancements**, this is where you put your coding skills to use.

5️⃣ Once your changes are ready, you may then commit and push the changes from your working branch:
```bash
git commit -m "fix(xxxx-name_of_bug): nice commit description"
git push origin feature/1022-kubecost-integration
```

6️⃣ While submitting Pull Request, **make sure to change the base branch from**: [master](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/tree/master) to [develop](v). Making sure to avoid any possible merge conflicts

### Keeping your Fork Up-to-Date

If you plan on doing anything more than just a tiny quick fix, you’ll want to **make sure you keep your fork up to date** by tracking the original [“upstream” repo](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser) that you forked.

Follow the steps given below to do so:

1️⃣ Add the 'upstream' repo to list of remotes:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser.git
```

2️⃣ Fetch upstream repo’s branches and latest commits:
```bash
git fetch upstream
```

3️⃣ Checkout to the **\`develop\`** branch and merge the upstream:
```bash
git checkout develop
git merge upstream/develop
```

**Now, your local 'develop' branch is up-to-date with everything modified upstream!**


# 🚀 Contributing to Komiser Engine

The core Komiser Engine is written in Go (Golang) and leverages Go Modules. Here are the prerequisites to run Komiser on your local machine:

1. 🌐 **Go Version**:
   - Latest Go version (currently its **`1.19`**) must be installed if you want to build and/or make changes to the existing code. The binary **`go1.19`** should be available in your path.
     > 💡 If you wish to keep multiple versions of Go in your system and don't want to disturb the existing ones, refer [the guide](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install).

2. 🔧 **GOPATH**:
   - Ensure that the **`GOPATH`** environment variable is configured appropriately.


## 🛠️ Komiser Installation

### 1️⃣ Installing Komiser CLI
Follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.komiser.io/getting-started/installation) to install the **Komiser CLI** for your operating system.

### 2️⃣ Connect to a Cloud Account
To deploy a **self-hosted (local) instance** of Komiser, connect your Komiser CLI to a cloud account of your choice. Refer to the documentation of the [supported cloud providers](https://docs.komiser.io/configuration/cloud-providers/aws).

### 3️⃣ Accessing the Komiser UI
Access the dashboard UI at `http://localhost:3002` once the local Komiser instance is running.

## 🌟 Ways to Contribute to Komiser Engine

Komiser is an open-source cloud-agnostic resource manager. It helps you break down cloud resource costs at the resource level. As a cloud-agnostic cloud management tool, we always have more providers and cloud services to add, update, and cost-calculate.


### ☁️ Adding a new Cloud Provider

#### 1️⃣ Create provider.
Create `provider_name.go` in `providers/provider_name` directory.

#### 2️⃣  Add the following boilerplate:
```go
package PROVIDER_NAME

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	. "github.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers"
	"github.com/uptrace/bun"
)

func listOfSupportedServices() []FetchDataFunction {
	return []FetchDataFunction{}
}

func FetchProviderData(ctx context.Context, client ProviderClient, db *bun.DB) {
	for _, function := range listOfSupportedServices() {
		resources, err := function(ctx, client)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("[%s][PROVIDER] %s", client.Name, err)
		} else {
			for _, resource := range resources {
				db.NewInsert().Model(&resource).Exec(context.Background())
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### 3️⃣ Add SDK client details:
Add your client details to [**`providers/provider.go`**](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/blob/develop/providers/providers.go)

```go
type ProviderClient struct {
	AWSClient          *aws.Config
	DigitalOceanClient *godo.Client
	OciClient          common.ConfigurationProvider
	CivoClient         *civogo.Client
	K8sClient          *K8sClient
	LinodeClient       *linodego.Client
	TencentClient      *tccvm.Client
	AzureClient        *AzureClient
	ScalewayClient     *scw.Client
	MongoDBAtlasClient *mongodbatlas.Client
	GCPClient          *GCPClient
	Name               string
}

type AzureClient struct {
	Credentials    *azidentity.ClientSecretCredential
	SubscriptionId string
}
```

#### 4️⃣ Add provider configuration:
Add provider configuration in TOML format in **`config.toml`**

```toml
[[gcp]]
name="production"
source="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"
# path="./path/to/credentials/file" specify if 'CREDENTIALS_FILE' is used as source
profile="production"
```

#### 5️⃣ Compile a new Komiser binary:
```bash
go build
```

#### 6️⃣ Start a new Komiser development server:

```bash
./komiser start
```

### 🔋 Adding a new Cloud Service/Resource

Here are the general steps to add a new service/resource for a cloud provider in Komiser:

#### 1️⃣ Create Service
Create a new file `servicename.go` under the path `providers/provider_name/servicename`

#### 2️⃣ Add boilerplate
Add the following boilerplate code, which defines the structure of any new service/resource to be added for a cloud provider:

```go
package service

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"time"

	. "github.com/tailwarden/komiser/models"
	. "github.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers"
)

func MyServiceResources(ctx context.Context, client ProviderClient) ([]Resource, error) {
	resources := make([]Resource, 0)
	
    // Logic goes here

	log.Printf("[%s] Fetched %d CLOUD PROVIDER NAME resources\n", client.Name, len(resources))
	return resources, nil
}
```

To understand how to write the required logic, you may refer any [existing examples](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/tree/develop/providers/aws) for inspiration!

#### 3️⃣ Edit Provider
Call the `MyServiceResources()` function from the above file, by adding it to `providers/providername/provider.go` file's `listOfSupportedServices()` function.

```go
func listOfSupportedServices() []providers.FetchDataFunction {
	return []providers.FetchDataFunction{
		ec2.Instances,
		ec2.ElasticIps,
		lambda.Functions,
		ec2.Acls,
		ec2.Subnets,
		ec2.SecurityGroups,
		ec2.AutoScalingGroups,
		ec2.InternetGateways,
		iam.Roles,
		iam.InstanceProfiles,
		iam.OIDCProviders,
		iam.SamlProviders,
		iam.Groups,
.
.
.
```

#### 4️⃣
Do above mentioned steps [4](#4️⃣-add-provider-configuration), [5](#5️⃣-compile-a-new-komiser-binary) and [6](#6️⃣-start-a-new-komiser-development-server). You'll see a new resource/service added to Komiser, in the dashboard!

Additionally, [here](https://youtu.be/Vn5uc2elcVg?feature=shared) is a video tutorial of the entire process for your reference.

> 💡 Tip: you can also start the server via `go run *.go start --config ./config.toml` if you do want to skip the compile step!

### 3️⃣ Enhance existing Cloud service/resource

**So, you wish to improve the code quality of an existing cloud service/resource?** Feel free to discuss your ideas with us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.tailwarden.com) and [open a new issue](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/issues).

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

We leverage the [testing](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) package for tests. Test names follow the `TestXxx(*testing.T)` format where Xxx does not start with a lowercase letter. The function name serves to identify the test routine.
For creating a new test you create a `[name]_test.go` next to the file you'd like to test and replace `[name]` with your filename of the implementation. Look at any of the `*_test.go` files for an example or read the [official docs](https://pkg.go.dev/testing).
You then can run it with `go test /path/to/your/folder/where/the/test/is`. You can run all of our engine tests with `make tests`. You should see something similar to this:

```logtalk
go test ./... | grep -v /dashboard/
...

2. Ensure you're using the **latest versions** of the tech stack mentioned above.

## 🛠 Setup a Local Development Server

Let's get your hands dirty by setting up the Komiser dashboard:

### 1️⃣ Grab the Go Dependencies
```bash
go mod download
```

### 2️⃣ Configure `config.toml`

If it doesn't exist, create `config.toml` in the root and use this template:

```toml
[[aws]]
	name="sandbox"
	source="CREDENTIALS_FILE"
	path="./path/to/credentials/file"
	profile="default"

[[aws]]
	name="staging"
	source="CREDENTIALS_FILE"
	path="./path/to/credentials/file"
	profile="staging-account"

[[gcp]]
	name="production"
	source="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"
	# path="./path/to/credentials/file" specify if CREDENTIALS_FILE is used
	profile="production"

[sqlite]
  file="komiser.db"
```

> 📘 Dive deeper in our [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.komiser.io/getting-started/quickstart) for more configurations like connecting to PostgreSQL.

Now, craft your credentials. Check out the guides [here](https://docs.komiser.io/getting-started/quickstart#self-hosted) to tailor the config for your needs.

### 3️⃣ Boot Up the Komiser Backend
```bash
go run *.go start --config ./config.toml
```

> 🖥️ This fires up the dashboard at [`http://localhost:3002/`](http://localhost:3002). However, it mirrors the **`master`** branch. Let's make it reflect your development branch!

### 4️⃣ Navigate to the Dashboard Directory
```bash
cd dashboard
```

### 5️⃣ Set up Environment Variables
Create or update the **`.env`** file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 6️⃣ Spin up the Dev Server
Install dependencies and fire up the dev server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> 🟢 NodeJS: Ensure you're on the `18.x.x` LTS release.

Once done, open up [**`http://localhost:3002/`**](http://localhost:3002)
